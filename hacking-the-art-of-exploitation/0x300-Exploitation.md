###### Buffer Overflow

C is a high-level programming language, but it assumes that the programmer is responsible for data integrity. If this responsibility were shifted over to the compiler, the resulting binaries would be significantly slower, due to integrity checks on every variable. Also, this would remove a significant level of control from the programmer and complicate the language.

```c
root@kali:~/hacking/booksrc# cat overflow_example.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	int value = 5;
	char buffer_one[8], buffer_two[8];

	strcpy(buffer_one, "one"); /* put "one" into buffer_one */
	strcpy(buffer_two, "two"); /* put "two" into buffer_two */

	printf("[BEFORE] buffer_two is at %p and contains \'%s\'\n", buffer_two, buffer_two);
	printf("[BEFORE] buffer_one is at %p and contains \'%s\'\n", buffer_one, buffer_one);
	printf("[BEFORE] value is at %p and is %d (0x%08x)\n", &value, value, value);

	printf("\n[STRCPY] copying %d bytes into buffer_two\n\n",  strlen(argv[1]));
	strcpy(buffer_two, argv[1]); /* copy first argument into buffer_two */

	printf("[AFTER] buffer_two is at %p and contains \'%s\'\n", buffer_two, buffer_two);
	printf("[AFTER] buffer_one is at %p and contains \'%s\'\n", buffer_one, buffer_one);
	printf("[AFTER] value is at %p and is %d (0x%08x)\n", &value, value, value);
