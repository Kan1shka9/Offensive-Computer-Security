#### 0x200 Programming

```Assembly language``` ----Assembler----&rightarrow; ```Machine language```

```High-level language``` ----Compiler----&rightarrow; ```Machine language```

###### Pseudo-code

- English like 
- Arranged with a general structure 
- Similar to a high-level language

###### Control Structures

- If-Then-Else

```
If (condition) then 
{	Set of instructions to execute if the condition is met;} 
Else 
{	Set of instruction to execute if the condition is not met;}
```

- While/Until Loops

```
While (you are hungry) 
{	Find some food;	Eat the food; 
}
```

```
Until (you are not hungry) 
{	Find some food;	Eat the food; 
}
```

- For Loops

```
for (i=0; i<5; i++)
{
	Drive straight for 1 mile;
}
```

###### More Fundamental Programming Concepts

- Variables
	- Variables
	- Constants

```
int a, b; 
float k; 
char z;
```

```
int a = 13, b; 
float k;char z = 'A';
k = 3.14; 
z = 'w';b = a + 5;
```

- Arithmetic Operators

Operation | Symbol | Example
----------|--------|---------Addition 	| + | b = a + 5
Subtraction | - | b = a - 5
Multiplication | * | b = a * 5
Division | / | b = a / 5Modulo reduction | % | b = a % 5Full Expression | Shorthand | Explanation
----------------|-----------|-----------------
i = i + 1 | i++ or ++i | Add 1 to the variable
i = i - 1 | i-- or --i | Subtract 1 from the variable

Full Expression | Shorthand | Explanation
----------------|-----------|-----------------
i = i + 12 | i+=12 | Add some value to the variable.
i = i - 12 | i-=12 | Subtract some value from the variable.
i = i * 12 | i*=12 | Multiply some value by the variable.
i = i / 12 | i/=12 | Divide some value from the variable.

- Comparison Operators

Condition | Symbol | Example
----------|--------|-------------
Less than | < | (a<b)
Greater than | > | (a>b)
Less than or equal to | <= | (a<=b)
Greater than or equal to | >= | (a>=b)
Equal to | == | (a==b)
Not equal to | != | (a!=b)

Logic | Symbol | Example
------|--------|-------------
OR | ```||``` | ((a < b) || (a < c))
AND | ```&&``` | ((a < b) && !(a < c))

- Functions

```
int factorial(int x) 
{	int i;	for(i=1; i < x; i++)    	x *= i;  	return x;}```

```
int a = 5, b;b = factorial(a);
```

```
int factorial(int);
```
