###### CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

-  List of information security vulnerabilities that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems
- Goal is to make it easier to spread/share data
	- in house, between divisions, companies, researchers, etc.
	- across vulnerability databases
- Run by ```MITRE```
- Intended to be a comprehensive list of publicly known vulnerabilities & exposures
- Vulnerability
	- It is a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network
- Exposure
	- It is a mistake in software that allows access to information or capabilities that can be used be a hacker as a stepping-stone into a system or network

###### CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration)

- Assigns unique identifiers to configuration guidance statements

###### CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

- A software weakness is an error that may lead to a software vulnerability, such as those enumerated by the CVE list
- Examples software weaknesses include: 
	- buffer overflows, format strings, etc.
	- structure and validity problems; common special element manipulations
	- channel and path errors
	- handler errors
	- user interface errors
	- pathname traversal and equivalence errors
	- authentication errors
	- resource management errors
	- insufficient verification of data
	- code evaluation and injection
	- randomness and predictability
	
Weaknesses are a subset of bugs
